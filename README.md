## Radial Menu
A Radial Menu for Windows UWP Applications, as made popular by the first versions of the modern OneNote App for Windows. Create radial menus floating op top of your application. The control supports variable numbers of buttons, toggle & radio buttons, a selector for long lists, and a fancy metered menu for intuitive selection of numbers.

## Usage
At the core, this control comes with three user controls: The first one is a "floating" control, enabling a child control to float on top of all other elements, which allows the user to move the control around on the screen. The second one is the RadialMenuControl itself, which is able to house a number of RadialMenuButtons. Should a button contain a submenu, the button then houses a RadialMenuControl - and so on. You can have a virtually unlimited number of submenus.
